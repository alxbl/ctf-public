# Public CTF Challenges

These are challenges I have designed for past competitions or workshops.

They have been made public and adapted as much as possible to be deployable
standalone for people who wish to replay or try them.

No support will be provided. The source code is vulnerable and usually pretty
hacky. Do not use this in production environments.

Enjoy!
